        "The divisive Zack Snyder returns to the world of zombie action years after his breakthrough with a remake of George A. Romero's Dawn of the Dead, and the result is a bit of mindless undead fun. Dave Bautista stars as the leader of a ragtag group of former soldiers who are tasked with breaking into the zombie-overrun city of Las Vegas to retrieve millions in a safe under the city.",

        "Charlize Theron's Andy initially seems like another in her long line of sleek action heroes: Steely, determined and not to be trifled with. But while Andy bears surface similarities to those past roles, in Gina Prince-Bythewood's adaptation of the Greg Rucka comic book Theron gets to be something much more fascination: A tormented god-like creature, an immortal who has spent centuries trying to save humanity but is beginning to wonder whether it was worth all the trouble. Theron draws you in, and keeps you hooked.",

        "Looking for a movie that ticks all the right boxes to create your dream movie watching experience this month? Lin-Manuel Miranda-directed musical drama film tick, tick…BOOM! is here to serve up everything you want and more. The film is based on John Larson's 1990 stage musical production of the same name, and similarly follows an aspiring theatre composer (Andrew Garfield) who endures a quarter-life crisis as he approaches 30 and does not feel any closer to achieving his dream. Not only is there the amazing singing and dancing you'd expect from any Miranda-led project, but there is also a stunningly talented cast that includes Garfield, Alexandra Shipp, Judith Light, Vanessa Hudgens, Joshua Henry, Bradley Whitford, and Richard Kind, all poised to take you on a memorable musical moviegoing experience. Make sure to do yourselves a favor and catch tick, tick…BOOM!",
